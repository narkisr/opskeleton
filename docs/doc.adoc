== Introduction

Opskelaton is an opinionated bootstrap tool for local Sandbox projects, it aims to solve the following common issues:

* Developing Puppet/Chef modules/cookbooks on master machines which results with 'It works on my master/server' approach.
* Large monolithic Puppet/Chef code bases, code isn't modular or reusable.
* Implicit/Missing dependencies including: Ruby version, OS, gems, modules/cookbooks.
* Manual steps in setting up and maintaining such projects.
* Non standard layout, projects missing README and LICENSE files, no clear separation between developed and dependant code.
* Lacking development guidelines (for example extracting general modules and exporting them).
* No continues build, linting and testing, provisioning code is second class citizen.
 
Opskeleton comes to solve these issues by introducing a decentralized development work flow with pre-defined layout, packaging and dependency management.


== Usage

Currently Opskeleton supports Puppet and Chef, this guide is segmented to common functionality the respective separate sections for Puppet and Chef.

=== Installation

Perquisites (on Ubuntu):

* Vagrant 1.7.x
* RVM
* Ruby 2.1.x

```bash 
 $ rvm use system
 $ sudo gem install opskeleton
``` 

=== Boxes

Opskeleton recommends the use of [box-cutter](https://github.com/box-cutter) in order to create Vagrant boxes in a consistent manner (as no free hosting solution currently exist):
```bash
# make sure to have latest packer
$ packer version
Packer v0.6.0
$ git clone git@github.com:box-cutter/ubuntu-vm.git
$ cd ubuntu-vm
# Edit Makefile.local
$ cat Makefile.local
# Makefile.local
CM := puppet
CM_VERSION := 3.6.1
$ make virtualbox/ubuntu1404
```
A useful convention for Box names:

```bash
ubuntu-14.04_puppet-3.6.1 ([os]-[version]_[provisioner]-[version])
```

== Puppet

=== Introduction

Opskeleton supports the creation of Puppet based projects supporting dependency management (using librarian-puppet), linting and testing.


=== Structure

==== layout

Opskeleton generates the complete folder structure for projects:

==== module lifecycle

Opskelaton defines a module life cycle:

1. Internal non reusable modules (usually specific to a client site) go under static-modules
2. If we create a general reusable module which is ready for prime time we pull out to a new git repository.
3. The extracted module is added back as a third party (using [librarian-puppet](https://github.com/rodjek/librarian-puppet) module which resides under modules folder.

Life cycle scheme:

Creating new (static) modules is easy as:

```bash
$ opsk module foo
```

Each generated module will contain puppet-rspec with matching Rakefile. 

=== Testing

Opskelaton supports two levels of testing:

* Static module testing that includes rspec and linting.
* Integration testing using [serverspec](http://serverspec.org/) and Vagrant.

```bash
# linting all static modules
$ rake lint
# rspecing 
$ rake modspec
# running serverspec
$ rake spec
```

=== Packaging 
Opskelaton fully supports deployment and portable execution of sandboxes on non Vagrant environments:

```bash
$ opsk generate_puppet foo ubuntu-13.10
$ cd foo-sandbox
# The package version file
$ cat opsk.yaml
--- 
  version: '0.0.1'
  name: foo

# post bundle and gem install ..
$ opsk package
      create  pkg/foo-sandbox-0.0.1
      create  pkg/foo-sandbox-0.0.1/scripts
      create  pkg/foo-sandbox-0.0.1/scripts/lookup.rb
       chmod  pkg/foo-sandbox-0.0.1/scripts/lookup.rb
      create  pkg/foo-sandbox-0.0.1/scripts/run.sh
       chmod  pkg/foo-sandbox-0.0.1/scripts/run.sh
      create  pkg/foo-sandbox-0.0.1/manifests/site.pp
       exist  pkg
$ ls pkg
foo-sandbox-0.0.1  foo-sandbox-0.0.1.tar.gz
```
The packaging process creates a portable tar file that can be run on any machine with puppet installed via the bundled run.sh:

```bash 
$ tar -xvzf foo-sandbox-0.0.1.tar.gz
$ cd foo-sandbox-0.0.1 
$ sudo ./run.sh
```

An external node classifier based runner is also available under scripts/run.sh, this runner expects to get a <hostname>.yaml input file with the required node classes.


=== Deployment

 See [deploy](deploy.md)

=== Updating
Keeping you box up to date with latest opsk version is easy, just re-generate it again and resolve conflicts by answering y/n:
```bash
# Moving to latest opsk
$ gem update opskeleton
# foo box already exists
$ opsk generate foo <vagrant-box>
 exist  foo-sandbox
    conflict  foo-sandbox/Vagrantfile
Overwrite /home/ronen/code/foo-sandbox/Vagrantfile? (enter "h" for help) [Ynaqdh]
```

=== Vagrant
Opskeleton generates a Vagrant file with couple of enhancements:
 
* VAGRANT_BRIDGE (default eth0) for setting up public bridge on the go.
* PUPPET_ENV (default dev) for setting puppet environment.
* Puppet options preset to match modules and hiera folders.

=== Docker
The only assumption that Opskelaton makes is that the target host will have Pupppet installed, this enables us to create docker images from our sandboxes quite easily:

```bash
# creates dockerfiles/<host> and fig.yml
$ opsk dockerize
$ opsk package
# grabs the opsk tar file
$ sudo fig build
```

=== Benchmarking
Tracking the speed of our provisioning code is important for keeping a consistent level of service with the produced sandboxes, enabling benchmarking:

```bash 
$ opsk generate_puppet redis ubuntu-14.04 --bench-enable
# install imagemagic before bundle install
$ sudo apt-get install imagemagick libmagickwand-dev
$ rake serverspec:redis
# with each run more result lines will be recorded
$ cat benchmark.json
{"total":656,"host":"redis","revision":"5d03a41ade9fc3dd5296d4119ccb0b0ad8290b9e","time":"2014-12-17 02:57:45 +0200"}
# add it to git for tracking
$ git add benchmark.json
```

Now after a number of runs we could plot and view the results of a single host or of all the hosts side by side:

```bash 
$ rake plot:hosts plot:per_hosts
# resulting png files 
$ google-chrome plots
```
